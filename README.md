Ultimaker-Mod
=============

My modified Ultimaker design

Files have been modified to fit on the table of an Epilog Fusion 32" machine, and cut 
with color profiles (cut RGB red, etch RGB blue). Tests were done with cast acrylic for 
the 1/4" or 6mm parts (everything except file listed as 4mm) and birch plywood for the 
remaining (4mm) parts. 

Using clear acrylic for the majority of the body and a color for the back and bottom file 
produces a very nice look to the machine.
